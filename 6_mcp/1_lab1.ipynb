    "OpenAI Agents SDK recently upgraded their SDK and made a breaking change (thank you, OpenAI üòÇ). I haven't yet updated the version in this repo to the latest version. If you've upgraded the package yourself, then you might get an error about missing positional arguments. If you get that error, you'll need to replace `await server.list_tools()` with `await server.session.list_tools()` and change the last line from `fetch_tools` to `fetch_tools.tools`. And you'll need to make this change every time you get this error! The joys of working at the bleeding edge.."
