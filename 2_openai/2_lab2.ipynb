    "\n",
    "### 1. **Tools（Agent-as-tools）**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 一个 Agent 调用另一个 Agent 当作工具。\n",
    "* 调用时：**控制权还会回到原来的 Agent**。\n",
    "* 就像函数调用：A → 调用 B → B 返回结果 → A 继续执行。\n",
    "\n",
    "例子：\n",
    "\n",
    "* Email Manager 调用一个 `Grammar Agent` 来润色正文。\n",
    "* Grammar Agent 返回润色好的文本。\n",
    "* Email Manager 再继续执行后面的转换和发送。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Handoffs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 一个 Agent 把任务整个交给另一个 Agent，**控制权彻底移交**。\n",
    "* 原来的 Agent 不会等结果再回来继续，而是交出去后自己就退出了。\n",
    "* 就像责任转移：A → 发现任务适合 B → 把控制权交给 B → 从此 B 负责到底。\n",
    "\n",
    "例子：\n",
    "\n",
    "* Orchestrator Agent 收到“发一封邮件”。\n",
    "* 它判断这属于 Email Manager 的专业范围。\n",
    "* 它执行 handoff，把整个任务交给 Email Manager，自己不再管。\n",
    "* Email Manager 接管后，用自己的工具链完成“写标题 → 转 HTML → 发送”。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **那句话里的核心对比**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **With tools, control passes back**：调用完工具，控制权回到调用方。\n",
    "* **With handoffs, control passes across**：交给另一个 Agent，控制权完全转移过去。\n",
    "\n",
    "所以在你 `handoff_description=\"Convert an email to HTML and send it\"` 的例子里，这段描述就是 **告诉 Orchestrator 或别的 Agent：如果任务和这个描述匹配，你可以把控制权整个交给我，不用再接回去**。\n",
    "\n",
    "要不要我给你写一个伪代码对比：\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tool 调用流程\n",
    "* Handoff 转移流程\n",
